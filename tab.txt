maximum deflection in the meter. 
9. Tune the plunger of Klystron Mount for the maximum output. 
Block Diagram: -
10. Rotate the Knob of frequency meter slowly. At some particular position 
there will be a dip in micro-ammeter. Note down the frequency meter 
reading where output current is lowest. Read frequency directly between two 
horizontal lines and vertical marker in case of direct reading type wave meter 
and use the frequency chart to find frequency from micrometre reading. 
11. Change the reflector voltage and read the current and frequency for each 
reflector voltage. 
II. Square Wave Operation

fully anticlockwise position. 
5. Switch ‘ON’ the Klystron Power Supply, VSWR meter and cooling fan. Wait for 
few minutes. 
6. Switch ‘ON’ the Beam voltage switch and rotate the beam voltage knob 
clockwise up to 300 V deflections in meter. 
7. Keep the AM-MOD amplitude knob and AM-FRE, knob at the mid position. 
8. Rotate the reflector voltage knob to get deflection in VSWR meter. 
9. Rotate the AM-MOD amplitude knob to get the maximum output in VSWR 
meter. 
10. Maximize the deflection with frequency knob to get the maximum output 
in VSWR meter. 
11. If necessary, change the range switch of VSWR meter 30 dB or 50 dB if 
the deflection in VSWR meter is out of scale or less than normal scale 
respectively. Further the output can also be reduced by variable attenuator 
to set the output for any particular value.

EXP -8


Aim: -
 To demonstrate that the transmitting and receiving radiation patterns of an antenna 
are equal and hence confirm the reciprocity theorem of antennas.


EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: -
ATS04 with stepper motor controller, Dipole & Yagi antenna, Antenna pod and 
stepper pod with connecting cables 
PROCEDURE: -
1. Connect the Yagi Antenna to receiver stepper pod and set the frequency to 
3.8GHz. Keep the antenna in horizontal plane. 
2. Now connect a dipole antenna to the transmitter pod. 
3. Point the Yagi antenna is the direction of dipole with their elements parallel 
to each other as per figure. 
4. Set the distance between the antennas to be around 1m. Remove any stray 
object from around the antennas, especially in the line of sight. 
Avoid any unnecessary movement while taking the readings. 
5. Now rotate the Yagi antenna around its axis in steps of 5 degrees using 
stepper motor controller. Take the readings in ATS04 receiver at each step 
and note down. Plot the readings on the graph paper provided at back. 
6. Now without disturbing the setup, connect the antenna at stepper pod to the 
transmitter. Do not disturb their directions. Now Yagi is connected to 
transmitter and dipole at receiver. Take another set of readings by rotating 
the transmitter stepper pod from the controller every 5 degrees. 
7. Keep in mind that it is antenna that is being rotated is plotted in reception 
and transmission mode both for proving the reciprocity theorem. 
8. Observe the two plots and find if they are any different from each other. 
9.Plot these readings on Cartesian plane with distance between antennas on X 
axis and signal level in dB as Y-axis.
